I have produced designs for a website that meet client requirements. The design I have produced is a wireframe, with 4 different pages, 5 including the privacy policy. The client requirements included: A profile of the company itself, profiles of existing trainee web developers, job specifications and required qualifications, an on-line application form, and links to web development courses. In my wireframe I believe I have included each one of these client requirements. The first page is more of a main page, but also covers the objective of making a profile of the company, It has an image of the company, then a discription, and as a filler near the bottom is links to web development courses which also covers another objective but I felt like it was little enough to not need it's own page but I also included it on another page not just this. Also, every single page has the company logo at the top, a hamburger logo in the top right, and a link to the privacy policy at the bottom. Moving onto the second page, it covers the objective of showing off the existing trainees, so it has all 3 trainee images and descriptions, while at the top it has a bit of an introduction. The third page covers the job specifications and required qualifications objective, it contains a little introduction at the top, then a little lower is web design role description, and little lower is web developer role description, and near the bottom again is the links to web development courses so it kind of reminds the viewer as they view all the pages. The final and 4th page is the application form page which covers the application form requirement. It has a form title, info about the application form and then boxes to enter in information for your application and then a stock photo at the bottom to kind of take up space so it doesn't look completely empty and then all the other usual stuff like the link to the privacy policy, company logo, hamburger, etc. I also created a design for what it would look like if the hamburger icon is opened, and you can see it just has the 4 page categories from top to bottom. Finally, the last aspect is the privacy policy page, it is a simple page which just has a title and then the massive privacy description text which outlines the privacy policy.

I have also reviewed my website proposals/designs with others to identify and inform improvements. The exact response I got from the person who reviewed my wireframe was: "I have reviewed your wireframe and have looked at some clear improvements you can add to it. First you can start by adding a picture of the job to the third page, you have added images for all of the pages but that one which can help apllicants to see what the job will look like. I also think you could benefit with a proper footer instead of just privacy polcy." So the main improvements identified were to add at least some image to my job specification page (3d) because every single page other than that one has an image and it would show off what the job may look like or entail so I have added 2 image slots opposite the text boxes which describe the web design and web developer roles and so the images could represent each one of them. The other improvement which is a very good one and important is to have a proper footer rather than just a privacy policy. This was a complete mistake from me since every website has a normal footer with social media links, privacy policy links, terms and conditions links, contact link etc. and for me to not have this and just have a privacy policy would look and function pretty bad so it is very good that my friend informed me of this improvement and in response I added the footer, kept the privacy policy link but I don't really know exactly what other links I wil have so I just said "other details and links" so when I'm developing I can have freedom.
