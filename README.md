I have produced designs for a website that meet client requirements. The design I have produced is a wireframe, with 4 different pages, 5 including the privacy policy. The client requirements included: A profile of the company itself, profiles of existing trainee web developers, job specifications and required qualifications, an on-line application form, and links to web development courses.
